                            developed starting from an <span>actual personal struggle</span>: the chords are a lot 
                            and it is <span>very easy to get lost</span> among them (especially if you donâ€™t have a 
                            music theory knowledge). Then, all the useful things are dislocated in 
                            different places, websites and apps.

                            Hakulele has everything a new ukulele musician needs for starting playing 
                            the Hawaiian instrument.

                            The main feature is the ukulele tuner. The user can choose between a 
                            <span> static or a dynamic one.</span> With the static, you can listen to the right pitch 
                            of every chord and train your ears. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Otherwise, the dynamic tuner actively listens to what you are playing, 
                            recognizing the played chord and informing you about the state of its 
                            tuning. The <span>visual representation of the headstock</span> helps you to find the 
                            right tuner key.

                            <br/>
                            The other feature is focused on the Chords Tab library, divided by musical 
                            scales. From a picker, you can <span>choose the scale</span> and all its chords (from C 
                            to B) are visualised in the view. Every chord has its own tab which displays  
                            <span> how to place the fingers</span> on the fretboard.
