                            Barefoot College is an <span>Indian-based NGO</span> that operates in the poorest 
                            countries of the world where marginalized women face problems as 
                            <span>limited education, economic hardships, gender inequality and limited 
                            access to electricity.</span>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Thanks to a 6-months training, Barefoot College teaches these rural 
                            women the basics of electronics, allowing them to build, maintain and 
                            eventually sell solar powered products. They become <span>Solar Mamas.</span>
