                And this is where I finally found <span>my calling</span>. The Academy was the most 
                revolutionary experience of my life, a unique opportunity. It has not been 
                easy, I admit, but it is precisely <span>through challenges and difficulties </span> 
                (and failures) that one learns so much. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The first year as a student was exciting: through a <span>Learning by Doing </span> 
                approach and design challenges, month after month I was more and more 
                fascinated by the world of programming. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Finally I could personally make working solutions, <span>with my own hands</span>. 
                I had never felt so comfortable doing anything. Every line of code is a 
                challenge.... Programming is a mindset, and that's when I realized I 
                wanted to swim in it for the rest of my life. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I experimented with everything I had studied over time: marketing, 
                management, design, ux research. Only the last step was missing: <span>iOS
                app development</span>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I even took a second year there, as <span>Pier</span>. The approach is different, it's 
                not like the first year: this program is focused on <span>training future 
                professionals for working life</span>, in all its facets. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I was assigned to the project with the <span>NGO Barefoot College 
                International</span> and working for a commission, with real humanitary 
                challenges and demands was very formative and equally challenging... 
                but the experience with them was so dense and profound that I talk about 
                it separately in the next section.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <span>Knowing how to collaborate with your colleagues</span> is one of the most 
                important virtues in this industry, and in the Academy, I had the 
                opportunity to study and apply so many professional collaboration 
                methodologies and techniques: <span>Agile Methodology, Scrum 
                Framework, and a wide set of soft skills</span>, including crisis management, 
                feedback culture, emotional empathy and teamwork.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The Academy has given me so many <span>opportunities to challenge myself </span> 
                and especially to conquer my fears: presenting one's projects, explaining 
                its phases, what solutions are adopted and why... before I started 
                this journey, <span>public speaking</span> was unthinkable for me. It is almost symbolic 
                that I culminated this experience by presenting the Barefoot’s project at 
                the last Graduation Day, in front of the entire Academy, the press and 
                even <span>Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy 
                and Social Initiatives</span>.
