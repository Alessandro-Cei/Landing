                There are some experiences that are hard to explain, to rationalise: behind it there is a <span>mixture of emotions, 
                you’re teleported into another reality</span> that you believed to be far away from yours. But it does exist, 
                and it revolutionises your soul, you start to see the world from a completely different perspective. 
                You discover a world that’s much more raw, and all of a sudden you feel heavier, powerless. 
                The bubble pops and you feel the urge to help, <span>you feel called in</span>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Barefoot College International’s mission is to <span>help illiterate or semi-illiterate women</span> around 
                the world in facing problems like limited education, economic hardships, gender inequality 
                and limited access to electricity. Our contribution consisted in <span>developing a suite of apps </span> 
                to support the activities led by their division in Zanzibar.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Aside from the humanitarian aspect, this project was full of challenges on different levels, 
                first of all <span>illiteracy</span>. Developing digital products for western regions is relatively easy to do, 
                since you can always rely on best practices of UI structure and navigation: it’s safe to assume 
                that these users can read and have prior experience in using technological devices. 
                But <span>we had to question everything we took from granted</span>, since the African women that we worked 
                for didn’t know how to read and never touched a smartphone ever before.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Another challenge was linked to the project’s <span>technological requirements</span>: the suite of apps 
                (one for iPhone, one for iPad and a framework shared by the two) had a 4 year old codebase, 
                and the devices available to Barefoot College were running iOS12, so UIKit was the only 
                framework that could be used. This taught me to <span>adapt to compatibility requirements</span> both 
                regarding frameworks and coding style, trying to keep the projects as clean and performant as possible.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                But the real life changing experience has been traveling to Zanzibar, to <span>conduct an on site 
                usability testing</span> together with the women of Barefoot College. There, my bubble popped. 
                While you live things through the monitor of a computer, 6000 kilometres away from the issue, 
                you can’t really comprehend the scale and weight of it, but once arriving there in person 
                and <span>seeing how Zanzibari people really live</span>, in which context and situation…there you almost 
                feel guilty to live the life that you do.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You remain petrified, speechless. You don’t know how to help them and <span>you feel powerless in front 
                of something bigger than you</span>. I’m deeply grateful of having had the opportunity to 
                experience with them the same spaces, barefoot, sitting on carpets and <span>listening to new stories</span>. 
                Their smile shined with resilience while testing the apps with us because they managed to complete a task, 
                <span> they tasted hope in social redemption</span>.
