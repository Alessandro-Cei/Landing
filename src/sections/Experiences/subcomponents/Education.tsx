            I’ve always been curious of <span>understanding how people’s mind works</span>,
            so I’ve attendend a <span>Graphic Design Course</span>. Studying the visual 
            perception for me was like learning <span>how we actually see the world </span> 
            around us, how we explore and get info from the environment. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sadly, I wanted to deepen this research aspect of design, but I was ending 
            up being an advertising graphic designer. Not my thing, so I moved ahead.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My desire of understanding our world didn’t end there: another aspect to
            learn how things works out is through <span>marketing, business</span> and projects,
            studying current events, polishing a <span>methodological approach</span> to analize 
            situations and trends...
            <br/>
            <br/>
            So a <span>Bachelor Degree in Management</span> at the <span>Università di Pavia</span> fit all 
            these desires. It has been an interesting and revolutionary life experience
            but I felt that it wasn’t my real path: I wanted to get my hands dirty, not to 
            stay put behind a desk... 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Finding my purpose hasn’t been an easy thing, but only by trying I was 
            able to find my way. Only at the Apple Developer Academy I have found it.
